# Week-4 Pizza Order form

#### _Personal project for INTRO track at Epicodus, 9.29.17_

#### By _**Valia Dempsey**_

### Description
_The goal of this web page is to create a page with a pizza ordering form.
To see the page, go here: vdempsey.github.io/Pizza-Order._

### Logic to reflect user's choices:

The user is given directions to choose pizza size and one or more toppings. The user is given the base price for each size with >= 2 toppings. If the user chooses more than 2 toppings, the base price is increased by $1.99.

| CONDITION | USER CHOICE | OUTPUT MESSAGE |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| The user makes a size-choice and picks 2 toppings | small cheese & pepperoni | You will be getting small-sized pizza with the following toppings: cheese, pepperoni. Your total is $12.99 |
| The user makes a size-choice and picks 3 toppings | medium cheese, arugula, & olives | You will be getting medium-sized pizza with the following toppings: cheese, arugula, olives. Your total is $16.98 |
